# house-price-prediction-ML
Project: House Price Prediction with Data Engineering & ML from Scratch
(No Sklearn Models | No Auto Libraries)
1️⃣ Project Overview
Build a complete ML pipeline from raw data to prediction. you need to manually clean, process, and prepare data before training a Linear Regression model from scratch.
This project combines Data Engineering + Machine Learning fundamentals.
2️⃣ Objectives
• Handle real-world raw data
• Build data pipelines manually
• Perform feature engineering
• Implement ML from scratch
• Evaluate and compare results
3️⃣ Dataset
Kaggle House Price Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata
Features: Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Floors, Price, etc.
4️⃣ Rules
❌ No sklearn models, auto preprocessors, deep learning
✅ Only NumPy, basic Pandas (CSV load), Matplotlib, Python built-ins
5️⃣ Data Engineering Tasks (Manual)
• Data Ingestion: Load and validate files
• Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, outliers
• Validation: Check ranges and data types
• Feature Engineering: Create new features, normalize values
• Transformation: Shuffle and split data
• Versioning: Save raw and processed data
6️⃣ ML Model (From Scratch)
Model: Linear Regression
Equation: y = wx + b
Loss: Mean Squared Error
Training: Gradient Descent with manual weight updates
7️⃣ Pipeline Flow
Raw Data → Cleaning → Validation → Feature Engineering → Normalization → Train/Test Split → Training → Evaluation
8️⃣ Evaluation
Calculate manually:
• MSE
• RMSE
• R² Score
• Error plots
9️⃣ Comparison
Compare with sklearn LinearRegression (for reference only):
• Accuracy
• Error rate
• Training speed
